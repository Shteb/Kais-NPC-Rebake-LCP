- Select contents of either the "Grunt Rebake" folder or the "NPC Rebake" folder. *Do not select the folder itself*.
- Right click and select "Add to "folder-name.zip"
- Change the file extension to .lcp
  - Similar instructions will work for other non-Winrar compression programs

### Templates
Kai's Grunt rebake will be included due to it functioning more like a class. The Veteran rebake will not as it's designed to function with base NPCs and is therefore incompatible with the NPC rebakes.
