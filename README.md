# Kai's NPC Rebake LCP
A project to LCP-ify the playtest versions of Kai's NPC rebakes. For more info, please search the Pilot.net Discord for his pdfs.
# Check releases for the lcp file.
### To compile the lcp manually:
- Select contents of the "NPC Rebake" folder. *Do not select the folder itself*.
- Right click and select "Add to "folder-name.zip"
- Change the file extension to .lcp
  - Similar instructions will work for other non-Winrar compression programs
- Note that versioning will likely be broken for self compiled ones.
### Convention & Format
All ids are being named as "npc-rebake_(DEFAULT_ID_HERE)". See existing rebakes for examples.
All Classes are being named "(DEFAULT_CLASS_NAME) [K]". See existing rebakes for examples.
Classes and features are organised by Class alphabetically, then by feature as they appear in the PDFs.
