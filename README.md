# Kai's NPC Rebake LCP
A project to LCP-ify the playtest versions of Kai's NPC rebakes. For more info, please search the Pilot.net Discord for his pdfs.

Each folder is intended to be rezipped and renamed to an LCP individually. Step by step, that would be:
- Select contents of either the "Grunt Rebake" folder or the "NPC Rebake" folder. *Do not select the folder itself*.
- Right click and select "Add to "folder-name.zip"
- Change the file extension to .lcp
  - Similar instructions will work for other non-Winrar compression programs
### Convention & Format
All ids are being named as "npc-rebake_(DEFAULT_ID_HERE)". See existing rebakes for examples.
All Classes are being named "(DEFAULT_CLASS_NAME) [K]". See existing rebakes for examples.
Classes and features are organised by Class alphabetically, then by feature as they appear in the PDFs.

### When making changes
